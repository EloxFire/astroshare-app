    title: "What is Astroshare ?",
    description: "Astroshare was born from my passion for astronomy and the desire to make it accessible to everyone. When I first discovered this world, I was alone, without help to use my equipment. Today, as a member of an association (AAAOV), I can learn alongside experienced people. However, many don't have this opportunity. Thatâ€™s why I created Astroshare, a website offering astronomy enthusiasts, whether beginners or experienced, easy access to resources to learn in a fun and accessible way."
